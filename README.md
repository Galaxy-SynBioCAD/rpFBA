# REST rpFBA

REST tool that reads a collection of rpSBML files (in a tar.xz) and a GEM SBML model, merges the the two to simulate the introduction of a heterologous pathway to the organism of choice. FBA is then performed with all defined objectives defined by the [FBC](https://co.mbine.org/specifications/sbml.level-3.version-1.fbc.version-2.release-1) SBML package and saved inside custom (IBISBA) annotations. The output is also a collection of rpSBML files in a tar.xz. The merged version of the model may be kept instead of the heterologous pathway alone (default).
